# ACGPs - AragonCoop Governance Proposals

This is a space where AragonCoop Community members can create and submit Governance Proposals to be executed/obeyed by the AragonCoop members and its delegates (if any).

As we are starting a governance framework practically from zero, we propose to start operating our Governance over the rinkeby network. Once the Governance framework has shown itself to be stable enough, a migration to the mainnet shall be proposed and executed.

## Where are we taking decisions?
There are two organizations where the [AragonCoop Members](https://github.com/aragoncoop/membership) have their membership Tokens.

The [Mainnet DAO](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/0x940B2B518F761f4c52CDd9865C57D9a907DC5E82), which is currently holding the funds granted by the [AGP-40](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-40.md). This DAO is being used for signalling intentions from the AragonCoop over the ANV, and shall be used to allocate funds according to the AGP-40's mandate.

The [Rinkeby DAO](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/flight.aragonid.eth/), recently created, will be used to test this proposed ACGP process and have the community signalling about desired decisions about new membership process, management of the AragonCoop operations, processes and funds.
After having a first feedback from the community, we shall jointly decide which kind of decisions shall be migrated to the Mainnet DAO to consider them as completely binding or if we can consider the Rinkeby decisions as binding without going to mainnet.

## How do I propose a new ACGP?

It is as easy as cloning/copying the [ACGPtemplate.md](./ACGPtemplate.md) file and creating a new file with your proposal in the [ACGPs](./ACGPs/) folder in this Github repository and create yourself (you need to have a membership token of course) a new vote in the [Rinkeby DAO](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/flight.aragonid.eth/) once your AGP is in the master branch of this repository.

Please be sure that all the votes you create are done under the membership (MBR) token voting App. We have also a Merit (MRT) Token, but we shall not use it until we jointly define its minting rules and its features and functionalities (e.g. what kind of decisions we want to take under a reputation system instead of the democratic one that the Cooperative currently embrace?)
